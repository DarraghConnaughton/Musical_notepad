#First blog entry

Excited to the making progress on the project. My objectives are:
* Set up Android studio IDE.
* Write a basic C++ program.

//Set up Android studio IDE.
Successfully installed android studio. I chose the minimum SDK to be API 15: Android 4.0.3 (IceCreamSandwich), which will support 97.4% of devices.
